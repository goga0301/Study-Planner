### Question 1: Which of the following is NOT a Python data type?
A. Integer
B. Float
C. Character
D. Boolean

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Python doesn't have a dedicated character data type. Characters are represented as strings of length 1.

### Question 2: What will be the output of the following code: print(10 // 3)?
A. 3.33
B. 3
C. 3.0
D. 4

Correct answer: B

Explanation: The // operator performs integer (floor) division, which returns the quotient without the remainder, so 10 // 3 equals 3.

### Question 3: Which of the following is a mutable data structure in Python?
A. Tuple
B. String
C. List
D. Frozen Set

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation. Tuples, strings, and frozen sets are immutable.

### Question 1: Which data structure uses the LIFO principle?
A. Queue
B. Stack
C. Linked List
D. Binary Tree

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Stack operates on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

### Question 2: What is the time complexity for accessing an element in an array?
A. O(1)
B. O(log n)
C. O(n)
D. O(n log n)

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Arrays provide constant time O(1) access to elements because array elements are stored at contiguous memory locations.

### Question 3: Which of the following is NOT an advantage of a linked list over an array?
A. Dynamic size
B. Ease of insertion/deletion
C. Random access
D. No need for contiguous memory

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Linked lists do not provide random access to elements. To access an element, you need to traverse from the head, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

### Question 1: Which data structure follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle?
A. Queue
B. Linked List
C. Stack
D. Array

Correct answer: C

Explanation: A stack operates on the LIFO principle, where the last element added is the first one removed.

### Question 2: What is the average case time complexity for searching an element in a hash table?
A. O(n)
B. O(log n)
C. O(1)
D. O(n^2)

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Hash tables provide O(1) average case time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations due to the use of a hash function to directly access the element's location.

### Question 3: Which type of linked list has each node pointing to both the next and previous nodes?
A. Singly Linked List
B. Circular Linked List
C. Doubly Linked List
D. Array List

Correct answer: C

Explanation: A doubly linked list has nodes that contain pointers to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence.

### Question 4: Which data structure is characterized by having a fixed size in many languages and O(1) access time?
A. Linked List
B. Stack
C. Queue
D. Array

Correct answer: D

Explanation: Arrays typically have a fixed size and allow for O(1) access time because elements are stored in contiguous memory locations and can be accessed directly using their index.

### Question 5: Which of the following is NOT a type of tree mentioned in the study material?
A. Binary Tree
B. AVL Tree
C. Red-Black Tree
D. Graph Tree

Correct answer: D

Explanation: While graphs are data structures, "Graph Tree" is not a standard or recognized type of tree. The study material mentions Binary Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, and B-Tree as types of trees.
