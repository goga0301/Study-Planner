# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. Examples include:

- Classification: Predicting a categorical label (e.g., spam detection)
- Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices)

Common algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering. Examples include:

- Clustering: Grouping similar instances (e.g., customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables (e.g., PCA)

Common algorithms:
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is about taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Examples include:

- Game AI
- Robot navigation
- Resource management

Common algorithms:
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradients

## The Machine Learning Process

1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Selection
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Deployment
8. Monitoring and Maintenance

## Evaluation Metrics

For classification:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve and AUC

For regression:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared
